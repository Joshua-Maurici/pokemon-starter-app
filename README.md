### What does this application do? 
     This application provides the user with a short quiz about Pokemon in order to determine which starter pokemon they would get. 
     It allows for user input and simple navigation to get to the end result.

### What problem will this application solve?
    This application provides a short game like experience that engages the user.

### Why am I developing it?
    I am developing this application due to my love of Pokemon while also to showcase my ability and understanding of application development within the ruby language.

### Target Audience?
    This application is targeted at people who love the Pokemon franchise, other coders interested in how the app was made, users with a curiosity of what their starter pokemon man be as well 
    as potential future employee to show my ability to create an app from start to finish.  
     
### How will my target audience use this app?
    When you download this app it will be contained into one folder. In this folder there will be one file to run in order to start the application. Included will be a README with step by step instructions to 
    install any necessary files associated as well as some minor trouble shooting in the event something doesn't run correctly. As well as a guide on starting it directly from a terminal.

## **Features** 

### Menu System
    Using a while loop the user is shown multiple options. Those options are 1,2 or 3. They are accepted as integers and only those number will produce a result. In the event the user types something incorrectly the prompt will repeat itself and ask for only those numbers. The same principle applies if the user accidentally presses enter. They will be prompted to choose a number. This allows for a very simple and easy to use menu system. straight forward and has allows for mistakes to be corrected easily. 
### Scoring System
    The scoring system is an important part to the application. Being stored within the quiz itself it allows the application to track scores given by answers from the quiz. All done behind the scenes so the user doesn't see it but the application relies on it to produce a user based question towards the end. 
### Nested Questions
    These questions remain a key feature to this application as they produce a specify choice of three questions depending on the users score. This allows for user specification towards their choice. as example after Questions 6 the score it totalled and depending if its between a certain range it will go wo questions 7a, 7b or 7c.

## **Outline of the user interaction and experience for the application**
### How the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature?
    When the quiz is started the instruction are clearly printed on the screen with exact directions on what to do. In this case we see multiple options, for the menu they are told to enter either 1,2 or 3. With the questions we see that the input accepted is either a,b or c.   

### How the user will interact with / use each feature?
    The user only has limited interactivity to avoid error ensure ease of use. In the case of this application there are three types of input. The users name, menu selection and answer selection. All taken as simple text inputs. Also this is clearly stated in simple to read instructions of what to input. 

### How errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user?  
    In the event of any errors while using the application, a message will be displayed telling the user that an incorrect input was entered. It will repeat this message until the correct one is entered or the application is quit externally.
