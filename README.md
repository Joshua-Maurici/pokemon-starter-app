### Why am I developing it?
    I am developing this application due to my love of Pokemon while also to showcase my ability and understanding of application development within the ruby language.

### Target Audience?
    This application is targeted at people who love the Pokemon franchise, other coders interested in how the app was made, users with a curiosity of what their starter pokemon man be as well 
    as potential future employee to show my ability to create an app from start to finish.

    When you download this app it will be contained into one folder. In this folder there will be one file to run in order to start the application. Included will be a README with step by step instructions to 
    install any necessary files associated as well as some minor trouble shooting in the event something doesn't run correctly. As well as a guide on starting it directly from a terminal.

## Features 

### Menu System
    Using a while loop the user is shown multiple options. Those options are 1,2 or 3. They are accepted as integers and only those number will produce a result. In the event the user types something incorrectly the prompt will repeat itself and ask for only those numbers. The same principle applies if the user accidentally presses enter. They will be prompted to choose a number. This allows for a very simple and easy to use menu system. straight forward and has allows for mistakes to be corrected easily.
