    This app gives you multiple prompts based on the 3 starter types from Gen 1.
    Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur and tells you which one you get. 


### What does this application do? 
     This application provides the user with a short quiz about Pokemon in order to determine which starter pokemon they would get. 
     It allows for user input and simple navigation to get to the end result.
### What problem will this application solve?
    This application provides a short game like experience that engages the user.
### Why am I developing it?
    I am developing this application due to my love of Pokemon while also to showcase my ability and understanding of application development within the ruby language.
### Target Audience?
    This application is targeted at people who love the Pokemon franchise, other coders interested in how the app was made, users with a curiosity of what their starter pokemon man be as well 
    as potential future employee to show my ability to create an app from start to finish.   
### How will my target audience use this app?
    When you download this app it will be contained into one folder. In this folder there will be one file to run in order to start the application. Included will be a README with step by step instructions to 
    install any necessary files associated as well as some minor trouble shooting in the event something doesn't run correctly. As well as a guide on starting it directly from a terminal.
